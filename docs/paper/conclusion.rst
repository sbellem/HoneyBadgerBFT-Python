CONCLUSION
**********
We have presented HoneyBadgerBFT, the first efficient and high-throughput
asynchronous BFT protocol. Through our implementation and experimental results
we demonstrate that HoneyBadgerBFT can be a suitable component in incipient
cryptocurrency-inspired deployments of fault tolerant transaction processing
systems. More generally, we believe our work demonstrates the promise of
building dependable and transaction processing systems based on asynchronous
protocol.
